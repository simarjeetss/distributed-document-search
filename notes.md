# Distributed Systems

## Introduction

A distributed system is a network of multiple computers, each having its own processing power and memory, working together to achieve a common goal. These systems enable collaboration, resource sharing, and fault tolerance, making them essential in various fields, including cloud computing, telecommunications, and large-scale data processing.

## Important Terms

### 1. **Node**

A node refers to any individual device or computer within a distributed system. Each node is capable of processing, storing, and transmitting data independently.

### 2. **Communication Protocols**

Communication protocols define rules and conventions for data exchange between nodes in a distributed system. Examples include HTTP, TCP/IP, and MQTT.

### 3. **Concurrency**

Concurrency refers to the ability of a distributed system to handle multiple tasks simultaneously. It allows different nodes to execute operations independently without interfering with each other.

### 4. **Consistency**

Consistency ensures that all nodes in a distributed system have access to the same data at the same time. Achieving consistency often involves synchronization mechanisms and data replication strategies.

### 5. **Fault Tolerance**

Fault tolerance is the capability of a distributed system to continue functioning properly even in the presence of failures or errors in individual nodes. Techniques such as redundancy and error detection help maintain system integrity.

### 6. **Scalability**

Scalability refers to the ability of a distributed system to accommodate an increasing number of nodes or handle growing workloads efficiently. Horizontal and vertical scaling are common approaches to achieve scalability.

### 7. **Load Balancing**

Load balancing involves distributing incoming requests or tasks evenly across multiple nodes in a distributed system. This ensures optimal resource utilization and prevents any single node from becoming overwhelmed.

### 8. **Partitioning**

Partitioning involves dividing a distributed system into smaller, independent components or partitions. Each partition operates autonomously, enhancing system performance and fault isolation.

### 9. **Replication**

Replication involves creating and maintaining copies of data across multiple nodes in a distributed system. This improves data availability, reliability, and fault tolerance by ensuring redundancy.

### 10. **Distributed Database**

A distributed database is a collection of multiple interconnected databases spread across different nodes in a distributed system. It enables efficient data storage, retrieval, and management in large-scale applications.
